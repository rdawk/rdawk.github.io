                <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Early Days</h2>
                <p>Pittsburgh quickly became the industrial center for the United States in the early days. Due to Pittsburgh's easily navigable rivers and abundance of natural resources, it quickly became recognized as an important place during the early years. </p>
                <p>When most people think of Pittsburgh, the first thing that usually comes to their mind is steel. That is because Pittsburgh was an industrial hub for coal mining and steel production. The biggest contributor to steel production in Pittsburgh is Andrew Carnegie. He began producing steel in Pittsburgh in 1875. 26 years later, Carengie teamed up with Henry Clay Frick and merged together to become the United States Steel Corp.</p>
                <p>Up until the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh was the nations eighth-largest city and accounted for nearly half of national steel output. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, steel production started to disappear from Pittsburgh and started forming what Pittsburgh is today.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Today</h2>
                <p>Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself to become a hub for education, medicine, small manufacturing, and research. The University of Pittsburgh was a significant help to Pittsburgh's medical development. The University of Pittsburgh has a top tier medical school that is recognized all over the country. They also have a whole health care corporation called the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) which has hospitals all over Pittsburgh and surrounding areas!  </p>
                <p>Not to mention, the sports teams of Pittsburgh also have a heavy weight on the hearts of Pittsburgh residents. Even though the sports teams have been quite disappointing in the previous years, every year fans hope for something to change. </p>
